Daily Study Reminder — Data Analysis Roadmap

Tasks for today (check when done):
- [ ] Practice Excel: 30 minutes (formulas / pivot / cleaning)
- [ ] Do 3 SQL queries (SELECT / JOIN / GROUP BY)
- [ ] 1 short Python Pandas task or read notes (15–30 min)
- [ ] Push any work to GitHub and update README

Quick tips:
- Start with Day from your 7-day plan. Stick to time-boxed sessions (25–45 minutes).
- Reply to this issue with "Done" when complete, or add a short summary of what you did.
- If you want a different checklist, edit `.github/issue-templates/daily_reminder.md` and push.

Notes:
- This workflow will create a **new issue each day**. If you'd prefer a single issue that gets daily comments instead (keeps your Issues tab tidy), I can provide an alternate workflow.
